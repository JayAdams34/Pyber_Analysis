## Overview of the Pyber Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to understand the differences of ride-sharing data by city type, and how we can use those differences for decision making based the different areas. 

## Results of the Pyber Analysis
From our analysis, we can easily determine that Urban areas had higher total fares on average, most likely due to being larger populated areas. On the cotnrast rural areas had the lowest total fares due to less populated towns.

## Summary of the Pyber Analysis
Three business recommendations we can provide to the CEO in order to help address disparities among th city types are
  - For Rural areas, we should offer less rides during the lower peaks of winter and spring dates in order for the business to save more money.
  - For Urban areas, we should offer more rides during higher peaks of the winter and spring dtes in order for the business to make more money.
  - For Suburban areas, we should keep fares the same across the spring and winter months due to the lack of consistency in patterns when compared to Rural and Urban areas, unless we can add more information to the dataset to understand this issue.
